# PRICE PROVIDER
This project is a TypeScript application that enables users to interact with the crypto exchange Bybit to perform manual and automatic trading. Additionally, it provides a reporting system based on a Telegram chat, allowing users to receive real-time updates on their trades.

The application will use the Bybit API to connect to the exchange and perform trading actions such as placing orders, checking order status, and canceling orders. The application will also allow users to define trading strategies based on various technical indicators, such as moving averages and RSI.

To enable automatic trading, the application will be designed to run on a server or a cloud service, and will periodically check the market prices and evaluate the trading strategies. When a trade is detected, the application will place an order on Bybit based on the predefined trading rules.

The application will also provide a reporting system that uses a Telegram chat to update the user on their trades. The reporting system will include details such as the current status of open orders, executed trades, and the overall portfolio value. This reporting system will allow users to monitor their trading activity in real-time and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.
